PROBLEM:

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

========================================================

Sure, there is the brute force approach. We would only need to test up to
floor(sqrt(600851475143)), or 775146.

The LARGEST prime factor.

The answer points out: except for two, all primes are odd. so instead of adding one, do this:
2
3 +2
5 +2
7 +2, etc.

(i.e., test if even (div 2) separately, then do
	range(3, upperLimit, 2) -- fixed in 003.better.py. But not in this wayâ€”while loop with += 2.
	
I did, however, get the square root part right!
yay.

so nothing *too* fancy in this problem... prime factorization is sad, because you can't. though with quantum computers...!

[answer is 6857]

PROBLEM: doesn't always work. often returns composite numbers. (probably happens if a composite factors > the largest prime factor exists).
Please fix.
This is fixed in 003.better.py
