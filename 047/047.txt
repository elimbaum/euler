Project Euler 047
Distinct Prime Factors

General problem:
Find the first n consecutive integers to have n distinct prime factors.

n = 2
14 = 2 * 7
15 = 3 * 5

n = 3
644 = 2^2 *  7 * 23
645 = 3   *  5 * 43
646 = 2   * 17 * 19

n = 4
???



All primes, with the exception of 2 and 3, are of the form 6k +/- 1

Since we are checking for sequences of n consecutive, only have to check every n numbers. If it has n prime factors, look around; if not, continue.

Checking for prime factors: divide out all 2 and 3. Add to a set.

Keep a dictionary of previously factored numbers.
n -> {set of distinct prime factors}

and maybe just set union.

While not all 6kÂ±1 are prime, any that are composite will have a prime factor already seen by previous checks. Thus the only "primes" that will divide n will be themselves prime.

Lowest possible n will be product of first n primes
n = 2: 2 * 3 = 6
n = 3: 2 * 3 * 5 = 30
n = 4: 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 210


This is very slow!
Better to sieve & check, continuously
