Project Euler #13

Large Sum

In this problem, we are given 100 quantity 50-digit numbers and asked to find the sum. However the largest common integer data type (64 bits) can only hold up to ~10^19. Therefore this sum cannot be found directly.

However, the problem only asks for the first 10 digits of the sum, not the entire sum (which would be 51 digits long). 10 digits â€” or 10^10 - easily fits within the 64 bit integer. But we must also take carrying into consideration.

Through some thinking (using smaller numbers), it can be determined that only a couple of digits are necessary. For a list of 100 numbers, only 1 digit past the ten asked for need to be considered. In conclusion, the 50 digit numbers can be immediately and unconditionally truncated to 11-digit numbers, summed, and once more truncated to the required 10 digits.
