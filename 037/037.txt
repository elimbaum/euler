Euler 37
Truncatable primes

I thought I could use a sieve. But unfortunately not: no maximum is given. I only know that 11 such primes exist.

Ahh but this is interesting:
The example given is 3797.
3797 797 97 7 are all prime.
3797 379 37 3 are all prime.

This gave five truncatable primes, however: 3797, 797, 97, 379, and 37.

(A side note: of course the digits 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 may not appear anywhere, as in problem 35. But 2 and 5 actually may appear ONLY in two-digit truncatables, as this would then create a single digit prime)

Anyway: Once I find a truncatable prime, each of its components is also trucatable (by definition), and unless repeat digits come in to play, will most likely be distinct.

4 digit truncatables give 5 other truncatables.
5 digit truncatables give 7 other truncatables (below)

abcde abcd abc ab a
abcde bcde cde de e

Worst case scenario (i.e. all duplicates) an n-digit trucatable prime gives (n - 1) other trucatable primes.

This means that, as I need 6 more truncatable primes, the highest I could possibly expect to look is 7 digits: 10 million - 1.

But wait, there's more! If all of the digits were the same (theoretically), then they would be divisible by 11! If I assume that there won't be any repeats, then 5 digits will be more than enough: Check up to 99,999.

This means I can use a sieve! great.

****************

wait... This might be wrong. I am assuming that these subset-truncatables can be truncated from both directions. Not necessarily true. I'll write a brute-force-ish one first.

Or maybe I'll cheat and sieve up to 1 million, and figure out the real upper bound later.


After getting the answer with a slightly-sketchy brute-force-ish approach (sieve up to 1M), I see that the highest is about 750,000. Also, it only took 27ms... not bad.
