Pythagorean Triples

[Calculator]

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
a < b < c
a + b + c = 1000


[From wikipedia:]
To generate pythag tripels:
For any integers n, m; n > m:
a = n^2 - m^2
b = 2nm
c = n^2 + m^2


a + b + c = 1000
(n^2 - m^2) + 2nm + (n^2 + m^2) = 1000
2n^2 + 2nm = 1000
n(n + m) = 500

500/n - n = m

n must be a factor of 500, < Ã500)
n = 20; ==> m = 5
solve to get
a = 200; b = 375; c = 425


That wasn't too hard.
