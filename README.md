# euler

One of my computer-science hobbies in high school was not writing games or apps but instead tackling the [https://projecteuler.net/](Project Euler problems). These problems allowed me to integrate my love for computer science with my strong curiosity about higher math which I didn't get to experience in high school.

The file `euler.txt` logged all my work as I worked on the problems between 2013 and 2015. As first college applications, then work, and then college itself, ate up my time, I haven't had time to revisit the problems. This repository, however, still provides a fantastic look into my growth as a programmer and, most importantly, as a thinker.

Each subdirectory generally contains a `.txt` file containing my notes and thoughts before I started writing. Have a look around.
