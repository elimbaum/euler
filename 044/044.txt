Pentagon Numbers

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk âˆ’ Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?

x is pentagonal if 
sqrt(24 x + 1) = 5 (mod 6)

Putting ordering restrictions on the pair of pentagonal numbers, the maximum difference will be P_n - P_1 = P_n - 1.

The minimum difference will be between two adjacent; namely, P_n and P_(n-1)
P_n - P_(n-1)
= 3n - 2

Ah! But if P_j + P_k = P_n, then
P_n - P_k = P_j and
P_n - P_j = P_k

upper bound?

3n - 2 = m(3m - 1)/2
6n - 4 = m(3m - 1)
