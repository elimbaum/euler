What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

Easy! I think it can be done in O(1) with algebra.

F_n = round(phi^n / sqrt(5)
F_n ~ phi^n / sqrt(5)

Number of digits in F_n = log_10(F_n)
log(F_n) = log(phi^n / sqrt(5))
	 = log(phi^n) - log(sqrt(5))
	 = n * log(phi) - 1/2 * log(5)


1000 - 1= n * log(phi) - 1/2 * log(5)
       ^ because of digit offset

NOTE: for small n it didn't work... because it should be ceil, not round. Interestingly, it is no longer an issue when n is greater than around 75... an interesting pattern it creates.
