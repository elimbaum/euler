Project Euler 12

What is the first triangular number to have greater than 500 divisors?

Given a number n, its prime factorization is
p_1^x_1 * p_2^x_2 * p_3^x_3 ...
where p_n is a prime and x_n is the exponent on it.
In addition, n has
(x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1)(x_3 + 1) ...
divisors.

Therefore, since we are looking for a number with more than 500 divisors, a lower bound can be computer.

500	= 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 5
	= (x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1)(x_3 + 1)(x_4 + 1)(x_5 + 1)

x = {1, 1, 4, 4, 4}

To get the smallest number possible, small primes are given large exponents:

2^4 * 3^4 * 5^4 * 7^1 * 11^1 = 62 370 000
				(the first integer to have 500 divisors)

The closest triangular number n = 11169; T_n = 62 378 865.

The search will begin here; each successive triangular number will be factored through trial division and its number of divisors determined.



-- Post-solving notes:

Rather than trial divide against all odds, first generate a list of primes. As an upper bound, use the square root of the max integer value (32 bit), which is 65536. Only 6542 primes there.

HOWEVER: The overview points out that since all triangular numbers are of the form
n(n+1)/2
Each component can be factored individually (which ever one is even, divide by two).

This should run in only a few ms.
